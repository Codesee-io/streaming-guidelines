# Streaming with `<NAME>`

Thank you so much for joining! Below are some details for the show.

We’ll start with an introduction where we introduce our guests and give some background to the project.

## Tech Setup
  
We’ll be using StreamYard to host the live chat. All you’ll need is a browser that can open the link (Chrome works for sure).

When you enter StreamYard, you’ll be prompted to enter your display name. Please enter it including your pronouns and a Twitter handle, if one is available. For example:

    Ramón (he/him) | @hola_soy_milk

Please turn on your 'Do not disturb' settings on the computer you're streaming from, to be sure that these aren't accidentally shared via screenshares or happy accidents.

If you have a dedicated microphone you like to chat with, that’s wonderful! If not, we highly recommend using, say, some smartphone earphones with a microphone that’s close to your mouth.

If you can, we’d also recommend using a wired ethernet connection, but it’s not a big deal if not!

## Behaviour

We expect our hosts and guests on the show to lead by example. Respectful, non-harmful behaviour is required. Please do not use disparaging, foul language.
  
## Timing
  
We start at the time listed on the calendar, but please if you can join the StreamYard call 15 minutes before the top of the hour to make sure all the tech work is done.

The amount of time allotted on the calendar is a guideline. Please don't worry about sticking stricly to it! If we find a natural stopping point, we'll draw it to a close. If we go a little over, that's fine, too!

## VOD (video on demand)
  
Content will be streamed to Facebook, Twitch and YouTube simultaneously, the latter of which will be retained for viewing at any time.

## Moderation and chat
  
Don’t worry about any of this, we’ll handle it all for you! When there are relevant questions or comments from chat, your host will read them aloud for you to address. If you would like to, you can have a muted browser window pointed to `<TWITCH_URL>` to follow along with the chat in real time. Be aware that there is a lag between StreamYard and Twitch, so if you do have a window with Twitch open, it’s often helpful to drag your StreamYard window over the Twitch video to keep the different video speeds from being confusing.

## Promotion
  
We’ll be spreading the word on CodeSee’s social channels leading up to the stream. If you haven’t already done so, please provide us with a headshot and your Twitter handle (if you have one) to use on the promotional graphic. Lastly, feel free to retweet or share on your own platforms as well!
